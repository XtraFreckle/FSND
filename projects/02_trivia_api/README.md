# Full Stack API Final Project

## Full Stack Trivia

Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game. The application can:

1) Display questions - both all questions and by category. Each question entry shows the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.

2) Delete questions.

3) Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.

4) Search for questions based on a text query string.

5) Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.
  

## About the Stack

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a completed Flask and SQLAlchemy server.

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server.

## Setting up the Project Locally

To start the project locally, you need to setup both  `backend`  and  `frontend`  seperately. I suggest starting with the  `backend`  setup, because the  `React-App`  uses the data from the  `flask server`.
